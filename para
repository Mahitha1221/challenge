This project is a basic interactive math quiz created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML structures the quiz with three multiple-choice questions, each having four possible answers. CSS styles the quiz layout for better readability and user experience. When the user selects answers and clicks the submit button, JavaScript captures these selections. It then compares each selected answer to a predefined set of correct answers stored in an object. Based on this comparison, the script calculates the total number of correct responses. The final score is dynamically displayed on the same page without needing to reload. This approach allows instant feedback to users, making the quiz more engaging. The project is simple but effective for learning basic web development concepts like form handling and DOM manipulation. Additionally, it can be easily expanded with more questions or enhanced with features like timers and score tracking.
